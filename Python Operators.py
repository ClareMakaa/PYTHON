#Python Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, // - floor division, % - modulo, ** - Power
add = 10 + 5
print(add)
sub = 10 - 5
print(sub) 

#Python Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables. = assignment operator,+= addition ass, -=, *=, /=, %= remainder ass, **= exponent ass  
a= 7
a += 1 # a = a+1
a **= 10 # a = a ** 10

#Python Comparison Operators (return True or False): ==, != not equal to, >, <, >=, <=
a = 5
b = 2 
print(a>b)

#Python Logical Operators - used to check whether an expression is True or False: and, or, not
a= 5
b = 6
print((a>2) and (b>=6)) # Output is True

#Python Bitwise operators - act on operands as if they were strings of binary digits
#(& Bitwise AND, | Bitwise OR, - Bitwise NOT, ^ Bitwise XOR, >> Bitwise right shift, << Bitwise left shift)

#Python Identity operators - "is" and "is not" being used to check if two values are located on the same part of the memory. 

#Python Membership operators - "in" and "not in" are used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence (string, list, tuple, set, and dictionary).
